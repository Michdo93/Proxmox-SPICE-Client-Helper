# Proxmox-SPICE-Client-Helper
I use the virt-manager or virt-viewer as Proxmox SPICE client. This helper downloads a current .vv file and then executes it accordingly.

> [!NOTE]  
> You may want to make several VMs executable in this way. You then have to create each VM individually and for each VM you then need a new restricted user in Proxmox and a new API token for this new user. The Python script must then also be copied and adapted several times for each VM. The same applies to the batch/shell/bash script.

## Installation

### Virt-Viewer

#### Windows

If your client computer runs under windows you have to install:

* [usbredirect](https://www.spice-space.org/download/windows/usbredirect/usbredirect-x64-0.14.0.msi)
* [UsbDK x64](https://www.spice-space.org/download/windows/usbdk/UsbDk_1.0.22_x64.msi) or [UsbDK x86](https://www.spice-space.org/download/windows/usbdk/UsbDk_1.0.22_x86.msi)
* [Virt-Viewer x64](https://releases.pagure.org/virt-viewer/virt-viewer-x64-11.0-1.0.msi) or [Virt-Viewer x86](https://releases.pagure.org/virt-viewer/virt-viewer-x86-10.0-1.0.msi)

#### Linux

If your client computer runs under linux you have to install following:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install virt-viewer -y
```

### Python Dependencies

I assume that, regardless of whether Windows or Linux is used, Python 3 and Pip 3 are installed.

```
python3 -m pip install requests
```

The requests library is used to access the `REST API` of Proxmox.

### Proxmox SPICE Client Helper

Open a terminal/shell/cmd:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Michdo93/Proxmox-SPICE-Client-Helper
```

## Proxmox Configuration

### Datacenter

You want two things: on the one hand, a restricted user who can only operate the VM and, on the other, that he does not connect to the web interface if possible. In other words, they should not be able to log in using a password. It is therefore advisable to use the API token. The script can only be used to obtain access data for the REST API, but not to log in to the web interface. He does not know the correct login data. This also means that they cannot change the account password and you can continue to administer this account.

#### Users

First you have to create a new user. To do this, first click on `Datacenter`, then on `Permissions` and then on `Users`. By clicking on the `Add` button you can create your new user. Inside `User name` you can choose the name of your user. In my example I used `limiteduser`. Then you have to select `Proxmox VE authentication server` as `Realm`. This is needes because the user should be limited to only control the VM and he needs an access via the REST API. You can fill in the remaining fields as you wish or leave them blank.

#### API Tokens

In the next step, click on `Datacenter`, then also on `Permissions` and then on `API Tokens`. Then click on the `Add` button. As `User` you have to choose your user. In my case I used `limiteduser@pve`. Please notice that you have to choose `<user_name>@<realm>`. You can then assign a name for the `Token ID`. If you want, you can specify under 'Expire' when this token expires. I have simply selected `Never`. If you now click on `Add`, a `Secret` will appear in the next step, which you should copy and keep safe. Maybe just use a password manager like KeePass to store the secret of the token. You may also need several user accounts, so it doesn't hurt to keep them somewhere safe.

#### Roles

In the next step, click on `Datacenter`, then also on `Permissions` and then on `Roles`. After that you click on `Create`. For `Name` I choosed `VMViewer` but you can name it like you want. I found the name to be the most obvious and self-explanatory. On `Privileges` you select `VM.Audit`, `VM.Console` and `VM.PowerMgmt`. After adding the role it looks like this:

### VM

#### Hardware

At first you have to select your VM and go to `Hardware`. Make sure that `Display` is set to `SPICE`. I left the `BIOS` on the `Default (SeaBIOS)` setting, also Machine with `Default (i440fx)`. In my configuration the `SCSI Controller` is set to `VirtIO SCSI single`. I think you can customize your VM to your desire. Then I clicked on the `Add` button and choose `USB device`. There you have to select `Spice Port`. Maybe you will create two or three USB devices. Then I added an `Audi Device` by also clicking at first on the `Add` button and selected then `Audio device`. As `Audio Device` I selected `ich9-intel-hda` and as `Backend Driver` I selected `SPICE`. Maybe you have to choose a similar configuration.

![Hardware](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Michdo93/test2/refs/heads/main/proxmox_vm_hardware.png)

#### Options

In the next step you will click on `Options`. Make sure that `Start at boot` is activated, because later you will not login to Proxmox and start the VM manually if the server will reboot.

#### Permissions

In the last step you will click on the `Permissions` tab. Then you click `Add` and choose `API Token Permission`. In the next step you will select your `API token` (in my examle `limiteduser@pve!limiteduser-token`) on `API Token` and inside `Role` you choose `VMViewer`. After that you click on `Add`. Then you also had to add the `User Permission` by clicking again on `Add`. For `User` you have then to select your user (in my case `limiteduser@pve`) and inside `Role` you choose `VMViewer`. It is important that you add both permissions, otherwise running the VM will not work. At the end this looks like this.

## VM Configuration (inside the VM)

As example inside a linux VM you have to install:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install spice-vdagent spice-webdavd qemu-guest-agent -y
```

`spice-vdagent`: Enables extended SPICE support, such as mouse integration, clipboard and screen resolution.
`spice-webdavd`: Enables file transfer between host and guest via WebDAV.
`qemu-guest-agent`: Offers extended guest integrations (e.g. shutdown via Proxmox).

The spice-vdagent should start automatically after installation, but to be on the safe side you can start and activate the service:

```
sudo systemctl start spice-vdagent
sudo systemctl enable spice-vdagent
```

## Customize the Proxmox SPICE Client Helper

### Customize the Python Script

At the top of the Python script you can configure and customize the following:

```
# Set auth options (Token and Secret)
APITOKEN = ''  # Token (Username@Realm!TokenID)
APISECRET = ''  # Secret for the token

# Set VM ID and Node
VMID = ""
NODE = ""
PROXY = "" # IP or hostname
PORT = 8006
```

In my example the `VMID` was `102` and the `NODE` was `pve`.

### Customize the Batch Script (Windows)

The Batch script looks like this:

```
@echo off
REM Setze den Pfad zu Python und dem Skript im Home-Verzeichnis des aktuellen Benutzers
set PYTHON_PATH=C:\Python312\python.exe
set SCRIPT_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\Proxmox-SPICE-Client-Helper\virt_viewer.py  REM Home-Verzeichnis des aktuellen Benutzers

REM Führe das Python-Skript aus
"%PYTHON_PATH%" "%SCRIPT_PATH%"

REM Warte auf eine Eingabe, bevor das Fenster geschlossen wird
pause
```

* Maybe you have installed Python to another location
* Maybe you have installed Python in another version.
* Maybe you use multiple VMs which means you need multiple Python and Batch scripts.

### Customize the Bash Script (Linux)

```
#!/bin/bash
# Setze den Pfad zu Python und dem Skript im Home-Verzeichnis des aktuellen Benutzers
PYTHON_PATH="/usr/bin/python3"  # Pfad zu Python
SCRIPT_PATH="$HOME/Proxmox-SPICE-Client-Helper/virt_viewer.py"  # Home-Verzeichnis des aktuellen Benutzers

# Führe das Python-Skript aus
"$PYTHON_PATH" "$SCRIPT_PATH"

# Warte auf eine Eingabe (optional)
read -p "Press any key to continue..."
```

* Maybe you have installed Python to another location
* Maybe you have installed Python in another version.
* Maybe you use multiple VMs which means you need multiple Python and BASH scripts.

### Customize the Shell Script (Linux)

```
#!/bin/sh
# Setze den Pfad zu Python und dem Skript im Home-Verzeichnis des aktuellen Benutzers
PYTHON_PATH="/usr/bin/python3"  # Pfad zu Python
SCRIPT_PATH="$HOME/Proxmox-SPICE-Client-Helper/virt_viewer.py"  # Home-Verzeichnis des aktuellen Benutzers

# Führe das Python-Skript aus
"$PYTHON_PATH" "$SCRIPT_PATH"

# Warte auf eine Eingabe (optional)
read -p "Press any key to continue..."
```

* Maybe you have installed Python to another location
* Maybe you have installed Python in another version.
* Maybe you use multiple VMs which means you need multiple Python and Shell scripts.

## Usage

As example it will look like this:

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Michdo93/test2/refs/heads/main/proxmox_virt_viewer.png)

### Windows

On Windows you have to double click on your batch file.

Alternatively, change to the directory of the script in Powershell or in CMD and execute it as follows, for example:

```
.\virt_viewer.bat
```

### Linux

On Linux you can use BASH or Shell.

#### BASH

At first you have to make it executable. This looks for example like this:

```
chmod +x virt_viewer.bash
```

Then you can run it as example in your terminal with:

```
./virt_viewer.bash
```

or:

```
bash virt_viewer.bash
```

Change GNOME setting for double-click action: You can change these settings to automatically run a script in the terminal:

* Open the file manager (Nautilus) and go to Settings (gear icon top right).
* Select the Behavior tab.
* Under “Executable text files” you can select
* Execute (to run it immediately) or
* Ask (to decide whether you want to run or open it).

#### Shell

At first you have to make it executable. This looks for example like this:

```
chmod +x virt_viewer.sh
```

Then you can run it as example in your terminal with:

```
./virt_viewer.sh
```

Change GNOME setting for double-click action: You can change these settings to automatically run a script in the terminal:

* Open the file manager (Nautilus) and go to Settings (gear icon top right).
* Select the Behavior tab.
* Under “Executable text files” you can select
* Execute (to run it immediately) or
* Ask (to decide whether you want to run or open it).
